FE-Quantifed-Self is the front-end app for an Express API back-end.  
This was a solo project that I completed in just under 2 weeks in the following iterations: 

1. Build, test, & document back-end in my preferred language & framework: Ruby/Rails
2. Design & build a JavaScript front-end to consume the Rails back-end 
3. Build, test, & document back-end in a new language & framework: JavaScript/Express

Personal Objectives:

1. Style without the help of a CSS framework
2. Learn how to debug client-side
3. Build, test and organize an Express app
4. Learn how to test Express app with Mocha/Chai
